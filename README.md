## Project Description

PopcornPicks is a user-friendly movie recommender that curates a tailored list of 10 movie predictions based on user-provided movie preferences. Users can input their favorite movies, and our algorithm refines recommendations based on feedback‚ÄîLiked, Disliked, or Yet To Watch. Additionally, users can write reviews, save them, check out the latest movies out there and also check out the buzz going on about movies by viewing what others are writing for their reviews. For the system architecture and other details, please refer to our [wiki page](https://github.com/tanmaypardeshi/PopcornPicks/wiki)

## Future Scope

PopcornPicks is a dynamic project with endless possibilities for expansion and enhancement. Here are some exciting avenues for future development:

1. **Enahncements on the User Profile**: Implement more advanced features to the user profile. For example, include edit
or delete review option. Make validations for the duplicate reviews. These are a few examples of what can be enhanced in 
the future

2. **Integration with Streaming Services**: Integrate with popular streaming services to provide real-time availability information and seamless access to recommended movies.

3. **Dynamic Chat Rooms**: The current design of the application supports only a single chat room which is global to the website. The chat rooms can be made dynamic to a movie.

4. **Improved Recommendation Algorithm**: Enhance the recommendation engine with more advanced machine learning models and collaborative filtering techniques to provide even more accurate and personalized movie suggestions.

5. **Interactive Review System**: In this feature, users should be able to comment on other people's reviews so that the site can be more interactive and engaging for everyone

6. **Page for TV Shows**: Add a seperate section for TV shows. This can include shows from all streaming websites and television. This can be a parallel to the movies section of the website.

7. **Email Notifier**: Allow the user to send their favourite movie recommendations via email.

8. **Wishlist Feature**: Implement a feature where users can wishlist the recommendations they like and make lists of movies based on their preferences.

The future of PopcornPicks is full of potential, and we invite developers, movie lovers, and anyone passionate about cinema to join us in making this platform the ultimate movie companion.
